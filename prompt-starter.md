I would like help writing python code to do some data analysis locally. This means you do not need to run the code, but I would like the python code so I can run it locally. 
The Data looks like this
```Name,Age,Bib,Location,Pace,Finish Time
Alex Maier,M 25,#7,"Chapel Hill, NC, USA",4:34,32:02
Wesley Kiptoo,M 29,#1,Kenya,4:36,32:14
Nathan Martin,M 35,#17,"Jackson, MI, USA",4:40,32:43
Tsegay Tuemay,M 29,#33,Eritrea,4:41,32:50
Rory Linkletter,M 28,#9,Canada,4:42,32:56
Yemane Haileselassie,M 27,#25,Eritrea,4:44,33:11
...
Joseph Ahlers,M 44,#16976,"Bettendorf, IA, USA",14:32,1:41:46
Don Avjean,M 78,#17520,"Naples, FL, USA",14:32,1:41:47
Michael Koepp,M 43,#1927,"Davenport, IA, USA",14:33,1:41:48
Alexandra Larson,F 43,#1926,"Davenport, IA, USA",14:33,1:41:49
Brian Murray,M 66,#2268,"Davenport, IA, USA",14:33,1:41:50
Mary Beth Murray,F 59,#2269,"Davenport, IA, USA",14:33,1:41:51
Michael Ngo,M 69,#1977,"Moline, IL, USA",14:33,1:41:52
Aisha Mcccrady,F 34,#17273,"Davenport, IA, USA",14:33,1:41:54
```

Important Notes:
- Please make sure times are formatted like h:mm:ss not only minutes
- Everything is already installed and running. 
- I want a red line at 54:00 finishing time and 7:43 min/mi
- I want a purple line at 1:07:33 finishing time and 9:39 min/mi
- I'm writing out the analysis in boxes, so when I provide code, please rewrite it (without the imports)
- NEVER EVER TRY TO RUN IT! I AM GOING TO RUN IT LOCALLY.
